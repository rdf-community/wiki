# RDF Community on GitHub

A platform by the RDF community, for the RDF community

Welcome to RDF Community! This GitHub organization is dedicated to both newcomers and seasoned professionals interested in RDF and Linked Data, technologies known for their power but also for their steep learning curve. Our mission is to bridge this gap by providing a wealth of resources, facilitating learning, sharing, and growth within the community.

RDF Community aims to be a community-centric platform, managed and maintained collectively by members of the RDF community. We pride ourselves on being a vendor-independent organization, open and welcoming to all who wish to contribute. Participation is encouraged, and active contributors have the opportunity to join the [rdf-community GitHub organization](https://github.com/rdf-community) as administrators, playing a pivotal role in shaping the platform.

Our primary objective is to champion RDF and its accompanying technologies. Contributions that further this cause are highly encouraged. We value quality over quantity, striving to offer well-curated, opinionated content rather than an exhaustive directory of RDF resources.

For discussions, debates, and sharing insights about RDF, head over to our [community forum](https://github.com/rdf-community/discussions/discussions). While the forum is the go-to for community conversations, for more structured Q&A content, platforms like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) are recommended. Many of our community members are active there as well. If you're unsure whether your input qualifies as a question or a discussion, this [guide](https://meta.discourse.org/t/integrating-discourse-and-stackoverflow/69069/4) can help you decide where it fits best.
